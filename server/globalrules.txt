@cya@Global Chat Rules
@whi@You must read and agree to the following rules before being able to use the Global chat feature.
@cya@1.@whi@ Do not bring up grievances with other players in Global chat.
@cya@2.@whi@ Discussions of PKing are allowed, but PK "banter" does not belong in Global chat. Take that to private messages, and remain respectful.
@cya@3.@whi@ If you wish to talk with one person specifically, consider using private messages instead.
@cya@4.@whi@ Do not attempt to use Global chat as workaround for contacting players you can't private message.
@cya@5.@whi@ Global chat is held to a very high community standard.
@cya@6.@whi@ All our regular community rules also apply in Global chat.

Once you have read the above rules, please type @gre@::i_have_read_and_agree_to_the_global_chat_rules @whi@to agree to them and begin using Global chat
